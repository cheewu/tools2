/**
 * Represents a graph.
 *
 *  Algorithm copied from Wikipedia.org: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Algorithm
 *  ==================================================================================================
 *  Let the node at which we are starting be called the initial node. Let the distance of node Y be the distance from the initial
 *  node to Y. Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step.
 *  1. Assign to every node a distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.
 *  2. Mark all nodes as unvisited. Set initial node as current.
 *  3. For current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distance. For example, if current node
 *     (A) has distance of 6, and an edge connecting it with another node (B) is 2, the distance to B through A will be 6+2=8. If
 *     this distance is less than the previously recorded distance, overwrite the distance.
 *  4. When we are done considering all neighbors of the current node, mark it as visited. A visited node will not be checked
 *     ever again; its distance recorded now is final and minimal.
 *  5. If all nodes have been visited, finish. Otherwise, set the unvisited node with the smallest distance (from the initial node,
 *     considering all nodes in graph) as the next "current node" and continue from step 3.
 *  
 *	Notes
 *	=====
 *	This implementation is a working demonstration of how Dijkstra's algorithm could be implemented
 *	Legal inputs are assumed for all data
 *	The graph (all nodes and edges) is initialised with an array of Edges
 *	The output is text based to the standard console
 *	Integer.MAX_VALUE is the starting distance for all nodes (apart from the source which is 0)
 *	Each node is uniquely identified by a positive integer, starting at 0 for the source, and sequential
 *	Edges do not have unique ids, they are unique based on the 2 nodes that they join
 *	Each edge has a length that is greater than zero
 *	Every node must be joined to 1 or more other nodes
